# Sort 0-1-2 Array

- Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. 

- You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

- Note: O(n) does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For e.g. if you traverse the array twice, that would still be an O(n) solution but it will not count as single traversal.


# How to use it

- Run `./main.py` what will execute the test cases in `./tests` and a demo
